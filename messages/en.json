      "correlation_matrix": "Shows feature correlations: values range from -1 (strong negative) to 1 (strong positive). Darker colors indicate stronger relationships",
      "preprocessing_plot": "Parallel Coordinates plot visualizes multidimensional data with each vertical axis representing a feature and each line an observation. After bias mitigation, more aligned lines across sensitive groups indicate reduced bias.",
      "performance_plot": "Accuracy: measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made.\nPrecision: measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. It indicates the accuracy of positive predictions—how many of the predicted positives are actually correct.\nRecall (Sensitivity): measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives in the dataset. It indicates how effectively the model identifies actual positives.\nROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve): measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes. A higher value indicates better performance, with 1 being perfect discrimination and 0.5 representing no better than random guessing.\nF1 Score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics to provide a single measure of model accuracy, particularly useful in situations with an uneven class distribution.",
      "polarization_plot": "Polarized data refers to datasets where attributes or labels are highly skewed or clustered around certain extremes, often directly or indirectly related to sensitive characteristics like race, gender, or age. This type of data can highlight or exacerbate biases in AI systems, making it a useful tool for identifying and addressing fairness issues. Polarized data is  employed here to stress test AI models, helping to understand and define the system’s boundaries in terms of fairness by observing how it performs under extreme and varied conditions."
